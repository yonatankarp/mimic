# Mimic for Mac: design notes

The native app replaces the web page (`ui/`) and its Python server. Decisions below were made
on measurements from milestone 0; read them before changing one.

## Layout

| Part | What |
|---|---|
| `Sources/MimicCore` | Everything that isn't UI: jobs, the pipeline, Draw Things, health checks, the gallery on disk. No SwiftUI, so all of it is testable with `swift test`. |
| `Sources/Mimic` | One binary with two faces: `mimic <command>` in a terminal, the app otherwise. |
| `bundle.sh` | Assembles `Mimic Dev.app` (id `com.mimic.app.dev`) or, with `release`, `Mimic.app`. |

Build and test: `cd app && swift test && ./bundle.sh && open "build/Mimic Dev.app"`.

## Decisions

- **Swift owns everything except two Python pieces.** The 3D engine's wrapper
  (image-to-3dlab's `pixal3d_generate.py`, third-party) and `pipeline/mini_prep.py` (it runs
  inside Blender) stay Python. `make_mini.sh` and `drawthings.py` retire with the web page;
  the terminal route becomes `mimic make …`, the same code as the app.
- **Same data on disk.** `runs/<name>/` with `<name>.stl`, `<name>_{front,side,back}.png`,
  `source.png` and `settings.json` (`requested` / `made` / how it was made), so minis made by
  the web version appear in the app unchanged.
- **3D viewer: RealityKit.** Measured on the dwarf's 40 MB, 2.4M-vertex print file:
  Model I/O reads the STL in 0.08 s; SceneKit builds a scene in 0.03 s (265 MB); a RealityKit
  mesh takes 0.37 s (573 MB). Both are fine; SceneKit is no longer developed, so RealityKit.
  RealityKit can't open STL, so Model I/O reads it and the triangles become a `MeshResource`,
  flat-shaded (one normal per triangle, like every slicer).
- **Jobs run in their own session** (`GroupProcess`, `posix_spawn` + `POSIX_SPAWN_SETSID`),
  so Stop ends the whole chain. Foundation's `Process` can't do that. Proven by
  `GroupProcessTests`, including the test that shows the child surviving without a session.
- **Children get an explicit environment,** never the app's own: launched from the Dock, the
  app has launchd's bare PATH (`/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`), which lost Blender once.
- **Finding the Mimic folder:** the `installDir` default (written by the installer and by
  `bundle.sh` for the dev build), overridden by `MIMIC_HOME`. The app asks if neither works.
- **Notifications work from the self-assembled app:** `mimic --probe-notifications` inside
  the bundle reads the settings without a prompt (status 0, not yet asked).
- **Dev and release builds are different apps** (name and bundle id), so development never
  replaces the Mimic you use or shares its settings.
